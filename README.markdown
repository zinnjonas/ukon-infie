# General Info

This package is made for students of Information Engineering and Computer
Science at the University of Constance.

It contains useful commands for styling the assignments and generating
diagrams and graphs (not yet imported).

University and Department are hardcoded into the package but of course
changeable.

This package is still in an early alpha stage while our commands and functions
are integrated. So as always use at your own risk.

Feel free to use the Issue feature of Github to request features or give us
feedback or send bug reports.

Installation instructions and an example can be found on the [documentation pages](http://zinnjonas.github.com/ukon-infie/).

remains uncertain.
