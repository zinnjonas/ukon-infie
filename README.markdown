# General Info

This package is made for students of Information Engineering and Computer 
Science at the University of Constance.

It contains useful commands for styling the assignments and generating 
diagrams and graphs (not yet imported).

University and Department are hardcoded into the package but of course 
changeable.

This package is still in an early alpha stage while our commands and functions 
are integrated. So as always use at your own risk.

Feel free to use the Issue feature of Github to request features or give us 
feedback or send bug reports.

2010, refined throughout numerous assignments and night shifts.

The layout was passed down to us from older fellow students, the origin 
remains uncertain.
